Hi partner!

Hi Michelle- sorry this is taking me awhile

No worries! I am new to this too but we are all learning!

Thanks for understanding, I have to review things a couple times

We are crushing it!

Thanks for another chance, I need practice

No problem, it is defintiely good for me to practice too! I realized I hadn't checked the git project page to see the list of commits so it's good that we kept going.

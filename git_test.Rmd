Hi partner!

Hi Michelle- sorry this is taking me awhile

No worries! I am new to this too but we are all learning!

Thanks for understanding, I have to review things a couple times

We are crushing it!

Thanks for another chance, I need practice

No problem, it is defintiely good for me to practice too! I realized I hadn't checked the git project page to see the list of commits so it's good that we kept going.

I refreshed the page, but was not really checking it

It's probably not super important for this exercise but good to read the "commit messages" for the future! Do you feel comfortable now with the process? I am happy to practive more, just let me know!
